            <p>Hello, my name is Daanish Fiaz. I am an aspiring Software Developer. To tell you about myself, I'm just going to tell you what my hobbies are and what I am passionate about or love.</p>
            <p>I love working out because it reduces my stress and anxiety whilst improving my physique. I also have an extreme love for music because it allows me to connect with the people around me and the musicians themselves, it lets me know that I'm not alone. I collect records as well as I am teaching myself the guitar. My other hobbies include photography and gaming. I like photography because I can show people how I view the world, my perspective. I have been gaming since I was 3 years old, I like it because it's an escape from the real world that allows me to forget everything. Lastly, I also really like to read, reading allows me to become enriched by the storytelling of others and to increase my knowledge. I mainly read comics (marvel and dc).</p>
            <p>These are just a few of my hobbies that make me who I am :)</p>
